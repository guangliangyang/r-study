## Introduction
 
Airbnb, as a prominent product of the sharing economy, has indeed seen rapid growth in recent years, providing a unique alternative to traditional hotel accommodations with a wide range of short-term and long-term lodging options. Various studies have delved into different aspects of Airbnb, particularly focusing on the factors that influence customer satisfaction and ratings [@customer1]. One key area of research has been the impact of factors such as listing functionality, host attributes, customer reviews, and market conditions on guest satisfaction. These studies aim to understand how these elements collectively shape the overall experience of guests, ultimately influencing their review scores and the likelihood of them returning [@customer2]. For example, the quality of service provided by hosts, the amenities offered, and the location of the accommodation all play crucial roles in determining guest satisfaction levels [@customer3]. Moreover, research has also highlighted the significance of rental policies, listing reputation, and location in influencing guest satisfaction levels. Factors such as the clarity of rental policies, the reputation of the listing, and the convenience of the location can greatly impact how satisfied guests are with their overall experience [@customer4]. By examining these various factors that contribute to customer satisfaction in the context of Airbnb, researchers aim to provide valuable insights for hosts and practitioners to enhance the overall guest experience and increase customer satisfaction levels [@customer1].

In this project, we aim to extend this body of research by focusing on the factors influencing property ratings and guest satisfaction on Airbnb. Specifically, we will explore the relationship between high ratings  (scores greater than or equal to 95) and various predictors, including price, regional average price, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, host response rate, and room type. By building suitable models, we seek to uncover the determinants of high ratings and provide actionable insights for property owners. Additionally, we will analyze how these factors can be adjusted to optimize guest satisfaction and improve overall ratings, thereby enhancing the competitive edge of Airbnb listings.
